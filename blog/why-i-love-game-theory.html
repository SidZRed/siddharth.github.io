    <h1 class="blog-title">Why I Love Game Theory</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">July 29, 2025</p>

        Ever since I first encountered Game Theory, I’ve been fascinated by the idea that rational behavior can be modeled so precisely. It’s a subject that marries logic, mathematics, and human psychology — a rare combination that appeals deeply to both my analytical and curious sides.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it's Nash Equilibria, zero-sum games, or bargaining theory, each concept feels like peeling back a layer of how the world actually works. From auction design to multi-agent systems and even strategic coding contests, the relevance of game-theoretic thinking keeps surfacing in unexpected places.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my favorite things is applying these ideas in simulations — building agent-based models where each agent responds to incentives, constraints, and other agents. Seeing emergent behavior from simple rules is incredibly satisfying.
      </p>

      <p>
        I plan to explore more intersections between game theory, machine learning, and societal systems. Stay tuned for deeper dives into equilibrium computation, bounded rationality, and learning in games.
