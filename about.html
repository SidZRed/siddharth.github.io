        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Siddharth Reddy, an undergraduate at the <strong>Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore</strong>, pursuing a major in <strong>Mathematics and Computing</strong>. My academic journey has been deeply shaped by my curiosity for elegant theory and its real-world impact. I'm particularly passionate about <strong>Game Theory</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Approximation Algorithms</strong>, <strong>Data Structures</strong>, and <strong>Combinatorics</strong> — fields that allow for both strategic abstraction and rigorous analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and intelligent systems. I enjoy modeling real-world problems through mathematical lenses, often exploring questions of equilibrium, optimality, and efficiency under constraints of rationality and information. I'm especially excited by algorithmic game theory and its applications in decision-making, economics, and resource allocation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside my academic work, I seek practical exposure through simulations, coding projects, and competitions. This hands-on approach complements my theoretical foundation and enables me to build tools that are not only clever, but useful. Whether it's designing efficient algorithms or analyzing strategic behavior in complex systems, I aim to balance elegance with applicability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I’m an ardent follower of <strong>Formula 1</strong> and <strong>Cricket</strong>, appreciating the strategic nuances and data-driven decisions that drive success in both sports. My love for <strong>combinatorial games</strong> comes from the same mindset—seeking simplicity, yet uncovering deep patterns beneath. Follow my blog for insights into my interests, projects, and thoughts on the fascinating world of mathematics and computing.
